# Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether a shop that sells both surfboards and ice cream would be viable as a year round business in the state of Hawaii.

## Results

Looking at the results of the data accumulated, we can ascertain that:

-  The average temperature for Hawaii is warm, which bodes well for both surfboard and ice cream sales.  In the month of June, the average temperature is just under 75 degrees farenheit, while in December, it is just over 71 degrees.  Both would be considered temperatures on a nice summer day in most of the continental US.

-  The main concern is having a temperature that is too cold for selling both products.  Seeing that the bottom 25 percentile in December is 69 degrees farenheit and 73 degrees in June, we should see mininal days where the weather is too cold to either surf or eat ice cream.

-  Both June and December have temperature standard deviations under 4 degrees farenheit.  Thus, you're fairly certain that the weather will be comfortable more days than not, which bodes well for attracting both in state visitors and those who may come into town from out of state to seek out warm weather.

## Summary

If there was ever a place to open up a shop that sells both ice cream and surfboards year round, Hawaii seems like an optimal place based on temperature data.  However, before making a final recommendation, I would suggest that further investigation be done to ensure:

-  That there is a managebale frequency of heavy rain during June and December

-  The surf heights in June and December are conducive to surfing
